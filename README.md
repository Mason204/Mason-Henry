# Mason-Henry

Howdy-doody, my name is Mason Henry and I am currently a senior at Iowa State University studying Aerospace Engineering and looking towards potentially continuing my 
eduction and getting a masters in Aerospace Engineering.

I am currently working on expanding my programming knowledge by learning and working with C and Python in my Computational Techniques for Aerospace Design Class.

During the school year I am usually always busy so I don't have much time for hobbies but I do enjoy spending time with my wife to be Dana.
